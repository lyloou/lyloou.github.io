On the basis of how we specify JVM option it can be divided into two parts, JVM Options which starts with –X and those which starts with -XX:

> 1)    JVM Options that begin with -X are non-standard (thy are not guaranteed to be supported on all JVM implementations), and are subject to change without notice in subsequent releases of the JDK.
> 2)    JVM Options or parameters which are specified with -XX are not stable and are not recommended for casual use. These options are subject to change without notice also.
